# Learning Notes

This file captures concepts, definitions, and short explanations I want to keep as I build this project. It is not a full project log or methodology file. It is a running reference for understanding the data, tools, and modeling choices used in this repository.

## Elevation Model: DEM & Elevation Basics

### What is a DEM?
A DEM, or Digital Elevation Model, is a raster dataset where each cell stores elevation. It represents terrain height and can be used to understand slope, relief, and local elevation patterns.

### What is a raster?
A raster is a grid of cells or pixels. In elevation data, each cell contains a value such as ground height.

### What is a GeoTIFF?
A GeoTIFF is a common geospatial raster file format. It stores both the raster values and the geographic information needed to place the data correctly on a map.

### Why DEM data matters here
The DEM will help measure ground elevation across Toms River so I can compare parcels, flood zones, and eventually housing-related cost burdens. It is one of the main inputs for building parcel-level flood and insurance context.
